# 💡 Breaking Data Barriers  
### *Advancing Web Data Accessibility for the Visually Impaired*

> “Ensuring information is not just available but also **usable** and **meaningful** for everyone.”

## 📄 Abstract

In today’s digital era, access to information should be universal. Yet, for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, data accessibility—especially when it comes to graphical or spatial data—remains a persistent challenge.  
This thesis explores the **technological, ethical, and design-based frameworks** needed to make digital data truly inclusive. From **assistive technologies** to **deep learning**, this project proposes innovative solutions for better data interaction, sonification, and semantic structuring.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🔍 Examine current barriers in data accessibility for visually impaired users.
- 🧠 Review the state-of-the-art assistive technologies and methodologies.
- ⚙️ Propose inclusive design strategies using sonification, tactile interfaces, and semantic web enhancements.
- 🗺️ Present a roadmap for developing inclusive digital ecosystems.
